# Troubleshooting
## OAuth Errors
### Need admin approval: Subscription Management needs permission to access resources in your organization that only an admin can grant.
Subscription Management AD application requesting `user.profile` permissions to operate. For some tenants this permissions will require an admin consent. In case if such required, user with AD admin privileges should be perform an sign up process. 

### AADSTS53003: Access has been blocked by Conditional Access policies. The access policy does not allow token issuance. 
Subscription Management authenticates customers using [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) flow which includes obtaining an access token that allows an application to access user profile information. For some tenants, this capability is conditional and defined by Active Directory [Conditional Access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common). If case of AADSTS53003 error appears, it presumably due to such a conditional policy. To resolve it, [user who performs an activation should be excluded](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups#exclude-users) from such policy.
