# Pricing
**Subscription Management** (platform) as well as **Stripe** (payment provider) offers pay-as-you-go pricing, based on payments you process. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or hidden fees. You final price will be calculated as a sum of fees from both parties as defined in table below. 

| | Subscription Mgt. | Stripe
|-|-
Transaction fees | **7%** | **3.4%+30Â¢** ([region specific](https://stripe.com/pricing))
Both fees will be automatically applied to a transaction amount as transaction happens. There are no fees to refund a payment, but fees on the original payment will not be returned in case of a refund.
## Volume Discount
We would like to support our publishers with volume-based discount program. Publishers that show a significant sale over a year will receive a discount for a platform fee for the next full year as defined in a table below.

-|-
Sales (USD) | > 100,000 USD | > 500,000 USD
Discount (%) | **-14% OFF** | **-28% OFF**
Sales will be counted from the first successful customer payment and as the year passes and your sales volume is over defined threshold, the discount will be automatically applied to all publisher's active and future subscriptions. 

Stripe has its own volume-based discount program. Please [contact Stripe sales team ](https://stripe.com/en-nz/contact/sales)to get more information about it.
